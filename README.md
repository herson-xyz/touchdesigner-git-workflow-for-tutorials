## Description

Welcome to the TouchDesigner Learning Repository! This repository is a catch-all for tutorials, workshops, and general TouchDesigner learnings. The goal of this repository is to provide a space for testing a collaborative Git workflow and to document and share new things learned about TouchDesigner.

This repository serves two main purposes:

1. Testing a collaborative Git workflow for TouchDesigner
2. Documenting and sharing new things learned about TouchDesigner

Each new feature or concept learned in TouchDesigner will be treated as a new "feature" or "branch" in this repository.
